This project is an analysis of the US Accidents dataset which covers 49 states of the USA. The objective of our data analysis on U.S. accidents was done in order to find preventative measures. Preventative measures can afterwards be used in order to reduce the number of accidents that occur. Understanding this dataset would allow for the ability to limit the number of crashes that occur during a year. The US Accidents dataset can be used for real-time car accident prediction, casualty analysis, studying the impact of environmental stimuli on the occurrence of accidents, and even car accident hotspot locations. It also can be used to study the Covid-19 pandemic on traffic accidents and behavior.
